Alias Manager

Alias Manager is a cross-platform Python tool that lets you create command-line aliases on both your local machine and a remote machine with a single command. Whether you’re running macOS or Windows locally, this tool automatically sets up your alias on the local system and then SSHs into the remote machine (the “other” OS) to create the alias there as well.

Overview

Alias Manager is designed to streamline your workflow by allowing you to define shortcuts for frequently used commands. It supports:
	•	Dual Alias Creation: Creates an alias locally and on a remote machine.
	•	Cross-Platform Support: Works on macOS and Windows. When run locally on macOS, it assumes the remote is Windows, and vice versa.
	•	Minimal User Input: Only asks for the alias name and the command. Remote connection details are stored in a configuration file.
	•	SSH Authentication: Attempts to use key-based authentication first and falls back to password authentication if needed.
	•	Robust Logging and Error Handling: Logs all operations and gracefully handles errors.

Features
	•	Local Alias Creation:
	•	On macOS, appends the alias to the appropriate shell profile (e.g., ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc).
	•	On Windows, creates a .bat file in C:\Windows\System32 for use in both CMD and PowerShell.
	•	Remote Alias Creation:
	•	For remote macOS, appends the alias to ~/.bash_profile.
	•	For remote Windows, creates a .bat file in C:\Windows\System32 via an SSH connection.
	•	Automated Remote Configuration:
	•	On the first run, the tool will prompt you to enter your remote SSH credentials. These details are stored in ~/.alias_manager_config.json so you won’t be asked again.
	•	SSH Authentication Fallback:
	•	Attempts key-based authentication first. If it fails, it will automatically fall back to password-based authentication.

Requirements
	•	Python 3.6+ (for f-string support)
	•	Paramiko for SSH connections
Install via pip:

pip install paramiko


	•	Administrative privileges for operations on Windows (writing to C:\Windows\System32)

Installation
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AliasManager.git
cd AliasManager


	2.	Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(If you don’t have a requirements.txt, simply run pip install paramiko)

Configuration

The first time you run the script, it will check for a configuration file at ~/.alias_manager_config.json. If the file does not exist, it will prompt you to enter your remote SSH details:
	•	Remote Host: IP address or hostname of the remote machine.
	•	Remote Username: The SSH username for the remote machine.
	•	Remote Password: The SSH password for the remote machine.

These details are then saved in JSON format. For example:

{
  "remote_host": "192.168.1.2",
  "remote_username": "username",
  "remote_password": "password"
}

If you run Alias Manager on Windows, the configuration should contain the details for your remote macOS machine (and vice versa).

Usage

Simply run the main script. You will only be prompted for the alias name and command.

On macOS or Windows

python3 main.py

Or, if you need administrative privileges (for Windows alias creation in System32):

sudo python3 main.py

Example Interaction

Enter the alias name: ll
Enter the command for the alias: ls -la
Local alias created successfully.
Added alias 'll' on remote machine (windows) at host 192.168.1.2.
Remote alias created successfully on Windows machine.

Troubleshooting
	•	Syntax Errors / F-strings:
If you see a syntax error related to f-strings, ensure you are running the script with Python 3.6 or later. Use python3 main.py instead of python main.py.
	•	SSH Connection Issues:
Verify that your SSH keys are correctly set up, or ensure your remote password is accurate if key-based authentication fails.
	•	Permission Issues on Windows:
Creating a .bat file in C:\Windows\System32 requires administrative privileges. Run your script as an administrator.
